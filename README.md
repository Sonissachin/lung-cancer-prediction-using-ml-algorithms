Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve survival rates.  
This project focuses on predicting lung cancer using various **machine learning algorithms** based on patient-related features.

The goal is to build an efficient ML model that can classify whether a person is likely to have lung cancer or not.



Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are used and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  

---

 Dataset
- The dataset contains patient-related attributes such as:
  - Age  
  - Gender  
  - Smoking  
  - Alcohol consumption  
  - Chronic disease  
  - Fatigue  
  - Shortness of breath  
  - Chest pain  
- Target variable:
  - Lung Cancer (Yes / No)**

>Dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical data.
